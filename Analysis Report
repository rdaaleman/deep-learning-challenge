Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to be able to see what factors (classification, organization type, etc) can be predicted the best applicants for venture funding. 

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
is_successful 
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
application_type, affilitation, classification, use_case, income_amt, status
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
EIN and Name 

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
I used the numbers of neurons I used in order to best fit the model. When I used too little neurons it resulted in an underfitting. 
The activation function I used was "ReLU" because it's the most common for hidden layers which I had two of 

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
The final accuracy was 72.77% which is a pretty reliable accuracy of correctly classifying 72.77% of the samples. 

What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Having 100 epochs helped to train the model multiple times to get a better accuracy and increase the performance. 

Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
The losee was 0.5980 which is a little on the higher end and it would be better to have a lower loss to indicate a better-performing model 
It could be helpful to utilize a confusion matrix instead to get more information of the model's performance.
